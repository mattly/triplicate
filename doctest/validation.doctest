# Validations

Triplicate has some basic validation patterns built-in:
    
    >> class Form < Triplicate
            field :age, :in => 12..100
            end
    >> doc = {}
    >> form = Form.new(doc)
    
Setting a non-valid value will cause the form to fail validation:
    
    >> form[:age] = 6
    >> form.valid?
    => false
    >> form.valid?(:age)
    => false
    
However the value will still be there, and by default copied to the document as well:
    
    >> form[:age]
    => 6
    >> doc['age']
    => 6

Setting a valid value will clear the invalid status for the field:

    >> form[:age] = 21
    >> form.valid?(:age)
    => true

## Standard Validations

`field` observes the following parameters as validations:

`:in`: Given an `Enumerable`, checks to see if the value is a member of the enumerable with `include?`:

    >> Form.field :lucky_number, :in => [7, 42]
    >> form[:lucky_number] = 23
    >> form.valid?(:lucky_number)
    => false
    >> form[:lucky_number] = 42
    >> form.valid?(:lucky_number)
    => true
    
`:not_in`: Given an `Enumerable`, checks to see if the value is not a member of the enumerable with `include?`:

    >> Form.field :name, :not_in => %w(admin administrator god root sysop).freeze
    >> form[:name] = "admin"
    >> form.valid?(:name)
    => false
    >> form[:name] = "mattly"
    >> form.valid?(:name)
    => true

`:match`: Given a `Regexp`, checks to see if the value (when coerced to a string) matches the regexp:
    
    >> Form.field :name, :match => /\w{4,}/
    >> form[:name] = "foo"
    >> form.valid?(:name)
    => false
    >> form[:name] = "mattly"
    >> form.valid?(:name)
    => true
    >> form[:name] = 1234
    >> form.valid?(:name)
    => true
    >> form[:name]
    => 1234

`satisfy`: Given a `Proc`, calls the proc with the value, instance_exec'd on an OpenStruct representation of the form:

    >> Form.field :nickname, :satisfy => lambda{|val| name != val }
    >> form[:nickname] = form[:name]
    >> form.valid?(:nickname)
    => false
    >> form[:nickname] = "not the name"
    >> form.valid?(:nickname)
    => true

In `Object#instance_exec` is not defined (as it isn't by default in Ruby versions 1.8.6 and earlier) **OR** the given proc's arity is 2, the proc will instead be called normally, with the OpenStruct representation of the form passed in as the second parameter:
    
    >> Form.field :nick, :satisfy => lambda{|val, doc| doc.name != val }
    >> form[:nick] = form[:name]
    >> form.valid?(:nick)
    => false

Given a `Symbol`, `:satisfy` calls the method name represented by the symbol on the form, with the value as an argument:
    
    >> class Form
            def three?(val)
                val == 3
            end
            field :three, :satisfy => :three?
            end
    >> form[:three] = 4
    >> form.valid?(:three)
    => false
